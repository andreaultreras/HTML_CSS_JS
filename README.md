Hello!

I am trying to create a website where I can search through orders within a database. 
Later on I will add other specific features that I need for this application. One of the general things I will be adding
is a log in verification. I am considering using okta since I've seen a lot of that lately.

Right now I am struggling with the search forms page, mainly the logic. I am not sure how to go about searhcing for multiple fields
or if thats even a  thing I can do in express.
